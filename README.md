# Spell Check (Python)
This is a Python program for spell checking. It includes different examples of word lists and unit tests. The underlying paper for the computation of the edit distance is Oflazer (1996).

## Use

The program takes the name of the word list to load and the number of the max. edit distance as arguments via the shell. It will load the word list and build a trie out of that before running in an interactive mode. The user can type any word and the program will define if that word is correct or, if existing, propose a correct word in the given edit distance.

## Thanks

Thanks to the initiator of that project, Dr. Thomas Hanneforth, University of Potsdam, who directed the course "Working Methods of Computational Linguistics" in which that program was written.
